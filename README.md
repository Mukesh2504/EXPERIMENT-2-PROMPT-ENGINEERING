# EXP-2-PROMPT-ENGINEERING-

## Aim: 
Comparative Analysis of different types of Prompting patterns and explain with Various Test Scenarios

Experiment:
Test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios. 
Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses.

## Algorithm:
1.select different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios.
2.Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses.

## Test Scenarios & Prompts:

## Scenario 1: Factual Knowledge

# Prompt A (Broad/Unstructured):
“Explain blockchain.”

# Prompt B (Basic/Clear):
“Explain what blockchain is in exactly 5 bullet points (≤15 words each) and include one example use case.”

## Scenario 2: Reasoning/Math Problem

# Prompt A (Broad/Unstructured):
“Solve: A is 30% more efficient than B. B alone finishes in 23 days. Together?”

# Prompt B (Basic/Clear):
“Step by step, calculate how many days A and B working together will take to finish. Show formulas and give final answer in 2 decimals.”

## Scenario 3: Creative Writing

# Prompt A (Broad/Unstructured):
“Write a motivational story for students.”

# Prompt B (Basic/Clear):
“Write a 150–180 word motivational story for students in present tense, ending with a twist. Avoid clichés.”

## Scenario 4: Programming Help

# Prompt A (Broad/Unstructured):
“Write Python code to check if a number is prime.”
<img width="884" height="623" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce527c93-3612-473c-a82a-a1ea2c85f670" />

# Prompt B (Basic/Clear):
“Write a Python 3 function is_prime(n:int)->bool that checks if a number is prime. Handle n<2 and test with at least 3 assert statements.”

## output
| Aspect                   | Broad / Unstructured Prompt                                      | Basic / Clear Prompt                                     |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Quality of Response**  | Often generic, may include irrelevant details, lacks focus.      | More precise, relevant, and tailored to the task.        |
| **Accuracy**             | May misinterpret intent, leading to incomplete or vague answers. | Higher accuracy due to explicit instructions.            |
| **Depth of Explanation** | Tends to stay surface-level unless guided further.               | Provides structured, in-depth explanation with examples. |

## Result
Clear and structured prompts consistently generate more accurate and detailed responses compared to broad ones.
Unstructured prompts often lead to generic or unfocused outputs requiring further refinement.
Thus, effective prompt design directly improves response quality, accuracy, and depth in AI systems.
